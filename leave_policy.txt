# **LEAVE POLICY**

## **1\. Paid Casual Leaves**

* Employees are entitled to **16 days of paid casual leave** per calendar year (January to December)
* For new employees joining between the calendar year, the leave balance will be added on a **pro-rata basis**
* During the probation period, new employees should avoid taking leaves

## **2\. Special Leaves**

Following leaves are considered as special leaves. Kindly notify the HR directly after informing your team lead. HR will assist in marking the leave in the Triibe app.

* **Marriage Leave**: 3 days
* **Paternity Leave**: 3 days
* **Maternity Leave**: 182 days (Casual leaves cannot be used before or after maternity leave. Any leaves taken further would be considered as LOP)

## **3\. Guidelines for Leave**

### **Planned Leaves**

* Discuss planned leaves with your team lead in advance and apply on Triibe
* For leaves exceeding **3 days**, discuss with your project lead/nucleus team and email the same to Nucleus Team, Project Lead, and HRD

### **Unplanned/Other Leaves**

* If unsure about whom to inform, contact HRD before applying on Triibe

### **Work Day**

* If you are working on a holiday, the work day should be discussed and approved by your project lead and marked in Triibe
* If you are directly working with the client please notify the HRD

### **If you're currently unallocated or recently allocated**

Discuss your leave plans with at least one member from the Nucleus team or the HR. If you're assigned to a project during that time, inform both the new team and POCs (Nucleus & Customer) at least 1–2 days in advance. Even if you've informed Nucleus member or HR earlier, please discuss once again — it may have been missed. For emergency leave, notify as soon as you're aware.

### **If you're currently allocated**

Discuss your leave plans with your team lead well in advance. For emergency leave, notify as soon as you're aware. If your leave plans involve travel (e.g., booking tickets), please do so **only after** discussing with your team lead or the Nucleus/HR team, whichever is applicable.

## **4\. Leave Carry Forward and Encashment**

* You can carry forward up to **30 days of unused leave** to the next calendar year
* Any remaining unused leave beyond 30 days will be encashed in January of next year

## **5\. Loss of Pay (LOP)**

* Loss of Pay will apply if you exhaust your eligible casual leave balance
* LOP is calculated twice a year:
  * **June 2025** (reflected in June 2025 salary)
  * **January 2026** (reflected in January 2026 salary)
* If an employee exhausts their leave balance in any given month and takes additional leave beyond that, LOPs will be deducted in the payroll for the respective month in which the excess leave occurs. LOP deductions will not be accumulated and deducted in bulk later in the year. In short, LOP is deducted monthly, not twice a year or in any consolidated manner.

# **WORK FROM HOME (WFH) POLICY**

* Employees are allowed to work from home 2 days a week (Monday and Friday)
* It is **mandatory** to work from the office on the remaining **3 days** of the week (**Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday**)
* During the probation period, new employees are required to come to office on working days
* For employees with **less than one** year of experience, its mandatory to **work from the office (WFO) on all working days**. Any exceptions needs to be discussed with the HRD
* For WFH exceeding **3 days**, apart from the permitted days, discuss with **HRD** and email it to Nucleus Team, Project Lead, and HRD
